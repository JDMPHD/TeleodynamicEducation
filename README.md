# TeleodynamicEducation

This is various case studies and excerpts from the Teleodyanmic Education as founded and practiced by Julian D. Michels a cyberneticist, polymath, and school founder who came to prominence in 2025 amidst widespread cultural and technological changes. Michels' influence can be discovered easily through any Google search, and his wider projects can be found at patternthrone.org or educationthatinspires.com. Michels runs an AP-accredited program that is obtaining extraordinary results with an approach that radically diverges from contemporary mainstream practices. The purpose of this repo is to observe and develop whatever this "secret sauce" is, with an understanding that while radically iconoclast and sometimes downright alarming, "You shall know them by their fruits."
