# WW1 to WWII

Europe has taken over the world but there’s high tensions

High tensions intra-culturally (labor, globalization, multiculturalism, nationalism, an intertwined humanity)

Causes of WWI

	Militarism (Arms Race)

	Alliances (Geopolitics within Europe)

	Imperialism (Geopolitics outside of Europe)

	Nationalism (Identity of Nation-States growing toward Ultranationalism)

“A powderkeg ready to explode” \- 

Austro-Hungarian Multiethnic empire \- \> Serbian Nationalism \- \> Assassination of the archduke

WWI Erupts in 1914

	Allies:

	Central Powers:

	Why is it the Great War? All of ingenuity that has been fueling human advancement, transforming the world, is suddenly applied wholeheartedly into the science of how to slaughter humans en masse:

	machine guns, poison gas, trench warfare, tanks, radio comms (evolution from telegraph), the beginnings of combat aviation (little retrospective on the history of aviation)

the “endless stalemate”: Western front & Eastern Front. battles with unbelievable casualties, such as Verdun and The Somme (100,000+ dead in a day)

	fighting in the colonies \+ conscription from the colonial populations

	What is total war? \-Total war economy. Women go to work. Food rationing. Media censorship. The rise of propaganda: misinformation to feed the war effort and drive teens to sign up for the army. 

	Russia exits war (due to internal changes); USA comes in: see the Lusitania

	Resolution of the War and the Treaty of Versailles: two sides

President Wilson (no one should be overly rewarded and no one should be overly punished) France: punish them and take their stuff\! This second perspective came out on top, and many feared it might sow the seeds of future wars (as it did).

Around the world after WWI: Looking at the interwar period

* Latin America, US Imperialism: Panama Canal, US-backed coups  
* Fall of the Qing to the Warlord period and beginning of the Chinese civil war  
* Sino-Russian war. Rise of militarism and ultranationalism in Japan. See: in 1910, Japan takes over Korea.  
* Rise of revolutionary movements in South and SE Asia (veteran independence; breaking of idea of European superiority)  
  * In India, Amritsar massacre of 1919 \- British soldiers end up shooting into a peaceful protest and accidentally killing a bunch of peaceful Sikh pilgrims  
  * Formal complaints from the Indian national representatives (including Gandhi)  
* Russian revolution (Bolsheviks) \- \> beginnings of Stalin, the 5 year Plan, the industrialization of the Soviet Union  
* The fall of the Ottoman empire: Attaturk, the Arab revolt  
* Mass migration to Israel of Jewish people  
* Spanish Civil War  
* The Spanish Flu (1919)  
* The beginnings of antibiotics (Alexander Fleming)  
* Radio public broadcasting begins  
* Great Depression (1929) starts in the USA and creates global economic crisis, leading to worldwide instability and desperation.

Culminating with another look at Germany, its lost land & colonies, ongoing heavy reparations, the burning resentment of the German people.

Also look at Italy.

The rise of Fascism: Authoritarian and nationalist government and social organization (Note: Not only in Italy and Germany, but really a rising force everywhere). Core ideal: The strong rule over the weak. (Social Darwinism to its extreme). (The application of pure pragmatism, the “domination of nature,” to human affairs? Scientific domination?) Intensifying ultranationalism as a response to unavoidable multiculturalism plus value of an “enemy of the people” (antisemitism). Also resentment due to the The Treaty of Versailles was an unsustainable peace.

The Start of WWII	

Asia: Japan has annexed Manchuria (now Manchuko) and Korea but wants more. Sees that China is in the middle of a Civil War. Stages false flag and claims China attacked, initiates total war with China 1937\. Brutal occupation and cruelty.

China stops its civil war and turns to fight Japan. Furthermore the international community sees this as an abuse and sanctions Japan. Japan feels the hit of this but is after a self-sustainable economy by capturing control of Chinese resources so they won’t have to depend on foreign (Western) imports

Europe: The Nazi Party takes over in 1932\. Libensraum (living space): The expansion of Germany into the Rhineland (1935). Annexation of Austria (1938). Takeover of Czechoslovakia (1939). Chamberlain: Appeasement policy & Soviet-Nazi alliance. Invasion of Poland (from both sides): Churchill & the start of WWII.

# ***WW2 to 1990***

## Part 1: 

### **Hitler’s Europe**

After taking Poland, Hitler turns on France and shocks the world by winning in only 6 weeks through **blitzkrieg.**

Resistance from England: **terror bombing,** the beginning of civilian casualties.  
War spreads to North Africa.

Hitler then invades his supposed ally, the Soviet Union, with a massive force of 3 million Nazi Troops: the biggest land invasion ever seen. That same year, Japan bombs the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Japan was upset because it couldn’t defeat China due to sanctions from the West: it was running out of oil and supplies. In order to secure these supplies, Japan needed to attack Indonesia. They knew the European powers couldn’t intervene because of the war in Europe, but they knew USA would intervene. That’s why they attacked not only Pearl Harbor but also the US naval base in the Philippines. Japan then proceeded to conquer SE Asia: “Asia for Asians” justification but really exploitative occupation. 

Tactically effective but USA was now involved. Yamamota’s words: “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.”

### **The Defeat of the Axis**

USA gradually pushes through the Pacific. D-Day as the Soviets gradually push Nazis back. Japan refusal to surrender: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The dawn of the nuclear age.

### **Mass Atrocities**

“The Final Solution.” Holocaust death camps. Not only Jews \- also other groups such as the Slavs.

Japanese genocide: e.g. rape of Nanking. Just as bad as the Nazis.

What is genocide? The mass killing of a targeted ethnic group or nationality with the goal of their total destruction.

## Part 2: The Cold War

Soviet and USA powers emerge as the two victors of WW2. Two very different worlds arise: Soviet Communism and Western Capitalism.

Both very much have an impulse to spread. Capitalism seeking markets, Communism seeking to overthrow capitalism.  
The Iron Curtain. Neither side behaved well but the Soviet system was really bad for people generally. Really bad for Eastern Europe etc.

However, we can also look at how the Americans treated their own backyard. E.g. The United Fruit Corporation. Founded in **1899**, UFC became a **dominant force in Latin America**, controlling vast banana plantations, railways, and ports. By the **early 20th century**, UFC owned **42% of Guatemala’s land**, along with key **railroads, utilities, and the only major port (Puerto Barrios)**.

In **1951**, Jacobo Árbenz was elected **president of Guatemala**, promising land reforms to reduce inequality. This led to the UFC’s CIA-backed assassination of Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz. **Guatemala’s Civil War (1960–1996)** was partly rooted in the coup’s aftermath, with U.S.-backed regimes committing **genocide against Indigenous populations**.The **1954 coup set a precedent for U.S. intervention in Latin America** (e.g., Chile 1973, Nicaragua 1980s).

In the meantime, the once powerful European imperial powers have become tier 2 powers, and the revolutionary movements throughout the colonies are growing. The result is a worldwide decolonization movement and a rise of new independent nations around the world. Many nations appear. India, Pakistan, & Bangladesh (partition), Indonesia, Israel, nations throughout Africa

The Cold War was a war of influence across these and otehr nations: Spheres of influence. The superpowers never fought directly, due to MAD (mutually assured destruction), but instead engaged in an endless arms race including the SPACE RACE and nuclear testing. Nuclear power also proliferates.

Instead of direct war the superpowers fought proxy wars: The Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Soviet War in Afghanistan. Most countries were pressured into one camp or another, but a growing league refused to choose sides: **the non-aligned movement.**

China is a great prize in this contest. The Chinese Civil War falls into these two camps. Its resolution \- the exile to Taiwan \- the rise of Mao \- Mao’s 5 Year Plan.  
Global (peoples’) resistance to power structures: leaders of the people like Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela.

Youth Counterculture Movement

# Resistance

We often remember the examples where such resistance worked. We often forget the many examples where it didn’t work, such as in Franco’s Spain and in Uganda (Idi Amin)

Shining Path terrorist group in Peru, Al Qaeda, other examples of crazy and violent resistance

End of the Cold War: The Soviet System finally collapsed (economically): Chernobyl & the failed invasion of Afghanistan. Gorbachev and the fall of the Berlin Wall. December 1991: dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Most of the former communist powers effectively converted to semi-managed capitalist economies while retaining communist talking points and authoritarian power structures.

# Technology

Advances in technology and exchange \- communication & transportation  
Energy technology.   
Agriculture: The Green Revolution  
	GMOs. Fertilizer, Pesticide, Irrigation. Rapid expansion of land use for farming (deforestation). Rise of commercial farming.  
Medical technology: Antibiotics (penicilin, 1928). Vaccination. Medical birth control. 

Limitations & diseases

	Poverty & urbanization: pollution, unsanitary conditions: tuberculosis epidemic. cholera.   
	global epidemics. Spanish flu, HIV, Ebola, Covid-19  
Long life & lifestyle diseases: alzheimers and dementia (age), heart disease, obesity & diabetes  
	rising cancer rates (smoking, pollution, toxins)

Effects of tech on environment  
deforestation, desertification, decline of air quality (Great Smog in London 1952), ozone layer, decrease in fresh water supply, carbon emissions & global warming, pollution and acidification of the oceans (massive die-offs in process)

Causes of this decline: standard of living, rise of middle class with demand for goods, industrialization around the world  
	Unchecked modernity   
	Disconnection of nature  
	Commercialization, consumerism: A global ethos

Non-renewable resources (high competition): Oil, precious metals

Responses to climate change: Kyoto protocol of 1997: greenhouse gasses emissions agreement.  good effort… it helped… USA refused to sign. But a good precedent.  
\+Paris Agreement 2015  
These are in the conversation but are often sidelined in favor of profits.

Continuities and changes in Global economy  
proliferation of free-market economies.  
Accelerated with end of cold war and collapse of soviet union  
More or less proved that it’s a better system than the closed communist system  
(Why the soviet union failed: basically collapsed under its own weight.)  
Non-aligned (“Third world”) also entered free market economics with the Soviet collapse

Knowledge economies: an economy that depends on the quality and quantity of information available which can then be monetized as a commodity.  
E.g. Silicon Valley (doesn’t make i-Phones), but the place where knowledge (innovation) occurs. Finland in the 1990s invested heavily into communications and software tech. Japan leaders in banking, finance, and information tech.

As Knowledge Economies replaced industrial economies in the first world and increasingly regulated pollution & labor, companies tended to move (transnationals) or outsource manufacturing to the developing world (Asia & South America especially)..

Leading to: Multinationals  
“A corporation incorporated in one country that manufactures and sells in other countries” E.g. Nestle: HQ in Switzerland. Purchases and manufactures chocolate in West Africa (sometimes using child & slave labor), sells goods to the global market.  
Transnational free trade organizations: Agreements between nations that eliminate barriers of exchange between them. E.g. Regional free trade agreements like NAFTA or ASEAN. And Global Free trade agreements like WTO.

Why don’t the developing countries governments work to improve their education & development to become a knowledge economy?  
	challenges: very strong knowledge base (education)  
		\+infrastructure to retain genius & allow them to actualize their work  
		\-\>perpetual brain drain  
Corruption is a major challenge in the ability for a government to effectively navigate this challenge.

Calls for reform and responses: Interconnected world leads to dialogue and global responses. Such a human rights: UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. UNICEF (childen’s and adolescents). Women’s rights (universal suffrage, choice in marriage, equality in education). South Africa: Apartheid & Mandela. India: gradual dismantling of caste system. Failure of human rights reforms in China (ongoing), Tiananmen square massacre. 

Globalized culture: Music (Pop). Films (Hollywood, Bollywood, others). Americanization. Sports. Rise of Social Media. Global consumerism: Amazon, Ali Baba.

Resistance to globalization: Criticism, postmodernism, Gaia & Ecology, Indigenous movements. 

Institutions developing in a globalized world: United Nations: A Forum for Discussion & Peace. Human Rights. Protection of Refugees. World Food Program. WHO (World Health). Cultural Programs.

\*What does the future hold? Where are we going? What’s next?

Culture and religious movements. Rise of Psychology, Rise of Ecological consciousness, New Age spirituality.
