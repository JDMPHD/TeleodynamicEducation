# **Chapter 1: East Asia and the Mandate of Heaven**

**A Glimpse:**  In the predawn hush of Song dynasty China, a mother kneels before her eight-year-old daughter’s tiny feet. With utmost care she winds long silk strips tightly around each foot, pressing the arches down until the girl whimpers. The only sounds are the child’s sharp inhalations and the creak of fabric pulling bone. This painful custom – the breaking and tightly binding of a girl’s feet – has become a status symbol among the Chinese elite: delicate “lotus feet,” the key to a good marriage and honor. In the Song era (960–1279), society idealizes this as the epitome of feminine beauty and virtue, even as the practice cripples women’s mobility. These cultural ideals and social hierarchies will not vanish anytime soon, but like many traditions will pass down from one **dynasty** to the next.

---

The idea of a **dynasty** – a ruling family that holds power for generations – is central to East Asia’s story. For over two millennia, Chinese history moved in cycles from one dynasty to another, guided by a political philosophy known as the **Mandate of Heaven**. According to this ancient doctrine, a virtuous ruler, the **Son of Heaven**, is a bridge between humanity and the balance of the world. That is the nature of kingship – to maintain the harmony – and it gives the ruler the **mandate** to rule **“all under Heaven”**. As long as the correct, virtuous emperor holds this role, harmony and prosperity prevail. But if the ruling dynasty becomes corrupt or incompetent, Heaven withdraws its mandate: natural disasters, famines, and rebellions erupt as signs of cosmic disharmony. 

When the current dynasty loses the Mandate, subjects feel justified in rising up, seeing a successful revolt as proof that a new dynasty has gained divine favor. This **dynastic cycle** of rise, decline, and replacement repeated again and again in China’s history. Each new dynasty would claim the Mandate as justification for its take-over. Even non-Han conquerors, like the Mongols or Jurchen in later times, would adopt the idea of the Mandate to legitimize their rule over China. It’s notable that even this most powerful government in the world did not rule by force alone, but rose and fell by popular belief and **legitimacy.**

There were several archaic and classical Chinese dynasties stretching back even into the ancient past, but heading into more recent recorded history, we will begin here with the Tang and the Song.

---

## **The Tang**

The **Tang dynasty** rose around 618 CE and stood until 907 CE, illustrating a “golden age” of imperial Chinese civilization. Its capital (Chang’an) boasted a population of over a million people, the largest city in the world in its time. The Tang upheld a **protectorate** over the Silk Road oases, facilitating trade between China and the rest of Eurasia. Chinese ideas spread out to neighboring lands, leading to the emergence of **the Sinosphere**: a larger region of states deeply influenced by Chinese language, culture, and ways of life. 

This was aided by the Tang practice of maintaining an **imperial bureaucracy** of highly educated specialists. The Tang adopted and improved the old practice of the **Chinese** **civil-service**, a radical system of recruiting **scholar-officials** through **state examinations**. Young men of talent and intelligence, regardless of family background, could spend years studying history, poetry, philosophy, and Confucian classical literature in hopes of passing these exams and attaining a lifetime of government posts. In theory, this made the Chinese government **meritocratic:** an ideal in which power goes to those with the skill and virtue to use it for the common good. 

In practice, it is difficult to maintain meritocracy within institutions. Corruption and bribery tends to spread. Children of rich and powerful families end up favored in both selection and advancement. Even at the best of times, when direct corruption was discouraged, the fact remained that wealthy families were the only ones who could afford to pay for tutors and offer their children the years of uninterrupted and focused preparatory studies needed to excel on the exams. 

Thus, Chinese meritocracy was never perfect – but the effort to build a system that rewarded excellence with influence had a very positive impact on society, producing one of the most competent and long-lasting governments the world has ever seen. Dynasties rose and fell, but the educated class of administrators bound the empire together under a shared Confucian institution based (ideally at least) on values of intelligence and inner virtue.

Confucianism was the leading ideology of the government – but China was far from just Confucian. **Buddhism**, which had first entered China around 500 BCE, also reached a peak of influence during this period. The Tang welcomed Buddhist monks, built magnificent pagodas, and saw the rise of **Ch’an Buddhism** (elsewhere called Zen). Ch’an emphasized meditation and insight into one’s own nature – unmediated approaches that anyone could practice, not requiring monks or scholars or special rituals. Other more popularly accessible sects like Pure Land Buddhism similarly thrived, making it a religion of the people in contrast to Confucianism, which belonged more to the educated upper class. 

Yet, Buddhist monasteries also gained power, becoming centers not only of spirituality but also of education and even banking services. Buddhist art and literature enriched China everywhere. The ruling family and aristocracy also **patronized** Buddhist artists and scholars alongside their Confucian officials. What emerged was a great tree with three branches: Confucianism, Buddhism, and the third (smallest) branch of **Taoism**, an ancient indigenous wisdom tradition of flow, inner power, and harmony with nature. A rich multireligious and multicultural tapestry formed.

**A Glimpse:** It is 8th-century Chang’an, first morning light in the Tang Empire’s capital, and the world’s largest city stirs to life in a whirlwind of sights and sounds. Turkish merchants with fur hats and Persian traders in flowing robes shout bargains as they set up stalls brimming with silk, spices, and tea. The smell of frying dumplings mixes with incense from a nearby Buddhist temple where monks chanted sutras and bronze gongs tolled, their deep reverberations blessing the bustling market. An old Taoist fortune-teller is already setting up a stall, hoping to attract seekers with questions about life and the future. Through the morning crowd threads a nervous young scholar, a very serious teenager clutching a set of scrolls to his chest. Soon he will stand before the official Confucian sages, reciting ancient texts by heart, praying for a good evaluation on the test that will determine his life’s destiny.

The two greatest threats to central Chinese governments can be summarized briefly: 1\) internal disruptions such as droughts or floods could weaken agricultural production, leading to famine and peasant uprisings among the massive Chinese population; and 2\) the tribal horse nomads all along the northern (Mongolian / Manchurian) and western (Central Asian / Turkic) frontiers. 

The fall of great Chinese dynasties – again and again in history – have tended to involve a combination of both of these factors. That was certainly the case for the fall of the Tang. On the domestic front, unstable weather led to flooding which ruined crops and led to widespread famine. Famine led to crime and uprisings – which in turn gave rise to that perennial suspicion that the Tang had lost the **Mandate of Heaven**. Once this suspicion is active, it becomes difficult to raise taxes, to call up armies, or to otherwise organize collective efforts.

At the same time, the Tang had struggled like all dynasties to contain the ever-present threat of the horse nomads on their frontiers. One typical strategy (for the Chinese and many other empires in similar situations) was to fight fire with fire. This meant negotiating deals with nomadic tribes, hiring nomad leaders, or creating **buffer states** of nomad territories that allied with and worked for the empire. In the case of the Tang, the armies of the border zones were often staffed and commanded by tribal leaders and warriors who had joined the Tang military in such a role.

Such warrior-leaders were often far more effective at dealing with their own kind than the traditioanl Chinese army would ever be. The problem was that they tended to be far more loyal to their own ambitions than to the Chinese.

During the decline of the Tang, one such leader was **An Lushan,** a Central Asian warrior who joined the Tang military and rose through the ranks to become a *jiedushi*, the regional governor and top general of a frontier region. As the Mandate of Heaven waned, such regional warlords could go from being the frontline of Chinese defense to the greatest threat to Chinese security, as the weakness of the center allowed them to break free and declare independence. The **An Lushan Rebellion** was an example of just that, and while it was in fact successfully put down, the Tang never recovered from the blow.

This is a useful example of the dynamics that would play out again and again in the Chinese dynastic cycles. Internal instability would result from economic and agricultural crises. Powerful threats would rise from the frontier – either from outside of the empire (like the Mongols) or from the warlords of the border regions themselves (like An Lushan), with the note that the line between outsiders and insiders become blurry at these frontiers. Dynasties rarely fell in a single moment; rather, a series of crises would gradually weaken central rule over decades or centuries. At some point, some new leader would succeed in taking advantage of the resulting **power vacuum,** and would establish a **new dynasty.**

## **The Song**

This is what happened with the **Song dynasty** (960–1279), which was able to reunify China after the fall of the Tang. Culturally and technologically, the Song took Chinese civilization to new heights even as their military power was more limited. Where the Tang had been aristocratic and expansionist, the Song were more urban, commercial, and scholarly – especially after they lost the north. The **scholar- officials** of Confucianism dominated the Song even more than they had the Tang, carrying a freshly reinvigorated ideology known as **neo-Confucianism**. 

Neo-Confucianism de-emphasized the more ritualistic and mystical aspects of the tradition and instead stressed personal moral self-cultivation and obedience to social hierarchies – including stricter patriarchy. Practices like **foot-binding**, which had likely begun among dancers in the late Tang, became widespread among elites in the Song. A woman with **lotus feet** could not easily walk or work, making her **a dependent.** Only the wealthy could afford such dependency, which is part of why this became a status symbol for the elite.

Gender roles were not, however, entirely one-dimensional;; even as upper-class women’s mobility was literally constricted by bound feet, some enjoyed growing property rights, high levels of education, and authority at least within the household.

## **Zoom-In: Li Qingzhao – A Poetess in Wartime**

The autumn wind rattled the shutters of a scholar’s villa in Shandong as Li Qingzhao pressed her brush to paper. She was still a young bride then, newly wed to Zhao Mingcheng, a fellow lover of poetry and ancient bronzes. Their home overflowed with scrolls and stone rubbings, fragile treasures collected in a time when books were as precious as jewels. Evenings found them sitting side by side under lamplight, trading verses, teasing each other over calligraphy strokes, and dreaming that their collection would preserve China’s past for generations to come.

Then the Jurchens came. The  invasion of the 1120s brought smoke on the horizon as the cities of Northern China  fell one by one. The refined world they had built was suddenly fragile. Li Qingzhao and her husband hastily packed crates of books, paintings, and bronzes onto carts, abandoning their villa. She looked back at the courtyard garden where lotus leaves still floated in the pond and wondered if she would ever see it again.

The flight south was a blur of terror: muddy roads choked with refugees, soldiers demanding bribes at checkpoints, the sound of hooves in the distance. At night they camped under makeshift tents, clutching their manuscripts against the damp. Li wrote later of how the weight of their collection slowed them, yet neither could bear to leave it behind. “Our bodies suffered, but our hearts clung to the past,” she wrote. Her poem would last through the ages.

Exile took its toll. In a southern town, her beloved Zhao fell ill and died, leaving Li alone in a land still strange to her. Grief hollowed her heart, but she turned again to poetry. Her verses now carried a sharp ache: memories of shared laughter haunted by absence; love poems became elegies. “Ink cannot dry before my tears fall,” she penned, each line blending literary elegance with raw mourning.

She lived on in the **Southern Song**, a woman of letters in a time when war had silenced so many voices. Through her poetry, students centuries later would glimpse the human cost of dynastic upheaval – not through the proclamations of emperors, but through the trembling brushstrokes of a widowed poetess who had lost her home, her husband, and her world.

The Song economy was vibrant and **commercialized**, pulsing with entrepreneurial energy. Improved strains of rice – especially **Champa rice**, fast-ripening and drought-resistant – were imported from Vietnam as tribute and distributed to Chinese farmers. This innovation allowed **two harvests per year**, dramatically boosting grain output and feeding a population that swelled past 100 million. In the fertile **Yangtze River** valley, double-cropped rice paddies sustained bustling market towns, and by 1100 the empire’s **demographic** (population) center had shifted from its traditional home along the northern Yellow River to the Yangtze in the south. 

To integrate north and south, earlier rulers had built the **Grand Canal**, a monumental waterway linking the Yangtze basin to the Yellow River in the north. The Grand Canal wasn’t built all at once, but rather step by step over many centuries. The Yellow and Yangze rivers were finally connected by the Sui dynasty around 605 CE, and the Grand Canal became the empire’s **lifeline of trade**, the chief artery of internal commerce and taxation. It unified China’s economy by enabling bulk transport of grain, silk, and other goods between distant regions.

**A Glimpse:**  Under a warm Song dynasty sun, a long rice barge pulled by oxen glides up the placid waters of the Grand Canal toward the northern capital. Peasant villagers line the banks to watch the arrival of the golden rice sacks from fertile southern paddies. Among the onlookers, a farmer wipes his brow and marvels at the volume of production. Just last spring, he had planted the new fast-ripening strain from Champa. Now, just months later, **two** harvests have overflowed his storage baskets instead of one. The air echoes with villagers’ joyful chatter – born from the marriage of engineering and new grains. Many babies will be born this year.

While the Song lost Northern China to the Manchus – who would in turn be conquered by Genghis Khan and the Mongols – they continued to thrive in the south. This was the age of the **Southern Song** – a time in which, ironically, the reduced size of the Chinese state may have facilitated the concentration of its culture and technology. The Southern Song became an example of early **proto-industrialization:** a shift from **subsistence farming** (growing food for local populations to eat) toward **commercial production** (primarily making products to sell elsewhere). It was at this time that the Song began large-scale silk plantations.

Silk weavers, ceramic kiln-workers, and iron smelters turned out goods for sale across China and beyond. These home-based **cottage industries**, such as the famed **silk industry**, brought coin into rural households and blurred the line between farm and workshop. At the same time, government workshops manufactured armaments and high-quality ceramics (like the exquisite celadon and porcelain that would astound foreign traders). 

During this time, the Song are credited with the **“Four Great Inventions”** of China – **gunpowder, the magnetic compass, printing, and paper money**. Some of these in fact began earlier, but the Southern Song developed and commercialized the techniques. For example, **woodblock printing** had appeared in late Tang (the oldest printed book, the *Diamond Sutra*, dates to 868), but the Song expanded printing enormously. By the 11th century, inexpensive books flooded society; one 11th-century commoner, **Bi Sheng**, even invented **movable-type printing** with clay blocks around 1040 CE, centuries before Gutenberg developed his version in Germany. Bi Sheng’s press never became widespread, however, largely because Chinese **hanzi** simply has so many characters that manufacturing and storing blocks for each of them is rather impractical. This difference is a large part of why the printing press was more successful in Europe, with its much more manageable **phonetic alphabet.**

**Water clocks** and astronomical observatories represented the invention of **mathematical time** in the cities – the polymath engineer Su Song built a towering clock in Kaifeng around 1090, driven by a waterwheel and chain mechanism, which accurately displayed the stars and hours. This giant **water-powered clock** astonished contemporaries with its bronze rotating armillary sphere and automated mannequins ringing bells on the hour. 

In naval technology, Song shipbuilders were second to none: they built large ocean-going **junks** with sealed bulkheads for buoyancy, **sternpost rudders** for steering, and even **magnetic compasses** for navigation. By Shen Kuo’s time (11th century), Chinese mariners understood the concept of **true north** and were using the magnetic **needle compass** at sea. Song captains could navigate the foggy **China Seas** and beyond with these compasses, supplemented by celestial sighting instruments like the **astrolabe** (taken from the Islamic world) to gauge latitude. 

Armed with maps and compasses, fleets from Guangzhou and Quanzhou ventured through the **South China Sea**, reaching as far as Java, India, and the Persian Gulf. Sailors still tended to stick to **coastal navigation**, but improved ship designs enabled a thriving maritime trade route stretching from Asia to the Middle East, Africa, and even into Europe – sometimes called the “Maritime Silk Road.” By the 1100s, Chinese porcelain, silk, and spices were flowing west on Arab **dhows**, and in return foreign merchants brought ivory, frankincense, and gems into Chinese ports.

Commerce, too, was transformed by innovation. The government, needing to facilitate distant trade, issued the world’s earliest paper banknotes. Called **“flying cash”** for how quickly they moved, paper money was backed by deposits of coins and could be exchanged across great distances. By 1120, the Song state was circulating official notes (jiaozi), supplanting the need to haul strings of heavy copper coins. This saved on shipping weight and also discouraged **banditry**, because without proper identification, official notes were worthless to thieves.

These advances in financial technology allowed entrepreneurs to form networks of credit. Wealth increasingly becomes something immaterial – not even banknotes but rather pure numbers in some distributed set of ledgers, favors, and investments spread throughout the realm. Market towns swelled into cities teeming with shopkeepers, artisans, and financiers. Prosperity shot upwards. **Marco Polo** would later describe Hangzhou as “beyond dispute the finest and noblest city in the world.”

**A Glimpse:** In a Jiangnan village, the afternoon light slants through a small cottage where a wooden loom clatters. A young silk weaver deftly throws the shuttle back and forth, each rhythmic motion building shimmering yards of pale green silk. Piles of lustrous fabric grow at her feet. In a courtyard nearby, an eager alchemist carefully ground sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, murmuring a Daoist prayer for the elixir of immortality. 

Suddenly, the mixture ignites in a blinding flash, an explosion that sends him stumbling back in shock. This Daoist alchemist has accidentally discovered what will come to be called the new “fire chemical” – black powder. It will be systematized and it will spread: another testament to Song curiosity and innovation, the earliest version of gunpowder.

---

By the late Song, Chinese armies had begun adapting their black powder to fuel **gunpowder weapons** like fire lances and primitive bombs. In 1234, the Song even deployed the world’s first recorded **cannons** against the Mongols. These innovations gave Song China a military edge for a time – one Arab observer marvelled that Chinese city walls thundered with “earth-shaking thunderclap bombs.” However, these weapons remained primarily an experimental curiosity, not a strategic priority, and the Song’s advanced technology did not save them from eventual conquest.

The southern Chinese coastal cities continued to grow as the eastern origin of the Maritime Silk Road – warehouses filled with silk bolts and ceramics awaiting export, harbor waters forested with the masts of junks. Amongst the greatest of the Chinese ports was **Canton** (modern-day Guangzhou), a city on the South China Sea near to Hong Kong, which has been a gateway to the outside world since Tang times. 

By the time of the Song, Arab and Persian traders had formed **flourishing communities** in Guangzhou’s foreign quarters. They built mosques and introduced new ideas and goods, including the advanced mathematics and inventions of the Abbasid Muslim golden age. Simultaneously, overseas Chinese communities (**diasporic enclaves)** began forming in places like Vietnam, Java, and even further abroad. In this era, the concept of **the Sinosphere** truly extended beyond China’s borders.

To the east of the Asian mainland, **Korea** and **Japan** were deeply influenced by China while forging their own paths. **Korea** in the age of Tang and Song would come to be ruled by the **Goreo** (Koryŏ) kingdom, which actively engaged with China. Korea had allied with Tang China in the 7th century to unify the Korean Peninsula, and thereafter Korean scholars traveled to Chang’an, bringing back Confucian texts, Buddhist sutras, and all manner of Chinese knowledge. Korean elites adopted Chinese-style **imperial bureaucracy** in part, including a civil service examination system modeled on the Tang’s (though in Korea these exams remained largely limited to the aristocratic class). 

The Korean writing system remained based on Chinese characters (hanzi) for many centuries, and Buddhism became firmly established as the spiritual bedrock of Korean society. Yet Korea maintained its own identity – modifying Chinese institutions to suit native traditions. Still, as part of the **Sinosphere**, Korea readily accepted China’s cultural leadership, sending tribute missions and receiving in exchange the latest books and technologies. By Song times, Goreo’s craftsmen even pioneered moveable metal type printing and would use it to mass-produce Buddhist scriptures in the 13th century – which would allow Medieval Korea to emerge as a center of advanced learning and technology even ahead of China.

Meanwhile, to China’s north and west, the **steppe** and **forest peoples** – **Mongolia** and **Manchuria** – continued to pose perennial challenges to the agrarian **Han Chinese**. In the forests and plains beyond the Great Wall, non-Chinese dynasties rose: first the **Khitan** people established the Liao dynasty in the 10th century, then the **Jurchen** people (ancestors of the Manchus from Manchuria) formed the Jin dynasty in the 12th. These semi-nomadic conquerors seized portions of north China, forcing the Song to retreat south of the Yellow River after 1127\. 

Meanwhile, across the grass oceans of **Mongolia** roamed fierce nomadic horse tribes. In the early 13th century, a Mongol chieftain named Temujin would unite them as **Genghis Khan**, and his mounted hordes would storm across China’s borders. The Song held out valiantly with fortified cities and gunpowder weapons, and Genghis was never able to defeat them even as his forces conquered most of Asia and the Middle East. But in 1279, Genghis’ grandson Kublai Khan crushed the last Song stronghold and ended the dynasty. 

Yet even in conquest, China’s cultural gravity persisted. Kublai adopted the trappings of the Chinese and became the first emperor of the Yuan dynasty, continuing many Chinese institutions. The Mandate of Heaven, in Chinese eyes, had simply passed to a new, though foreign, clan. The Yuan would be required to maintain the Mandate in turn.

## **Japan**

Across the sea, **Japan** stood both within and apart from the Sinosphere. From early times, the Japanese had selectively borrowed from China – adopting Chinese characters for writing, embracing **Buddhism** (introduced via Korea around the 6th century), and modeling their imperial court on Tang lines. Nara and **Heian**\-kyō (Kyoto), Japan’s early capitals, were laid out as smaller versions of Chang’an, with grid streets and palace compounds. Japanese elites studied Confucian classics and Buddhist sutras, while **Shinto** – Japan’s indigenous religion of nature spirits or **kami** – comfortably coexisted with imported Buddhism through **syncretism**. (Kami were often seen as local manifestations of Buddhist deities.)

By 800 CE, Japan was in the midst of a brilliant **classical** era of its own: the **Heian** period. Heian Japan was known for art, poetry, and courtly refinement – one of the world's earliest novels, *The Tale of Genji* by Lady Murasaki, was written around 1000 CE and captures this elegant world. 

But unlike China’s centralized bureaucracy, Japan’s imperial household had little actual power. Instead, power was held primarily by the chief advisors of the realm – the Fujiwara clan – and the various powerful warrior clans throughout the land. In the late 12th century, a war erupted in which the Fujiwaras were **deposed** and the warrior clans seized power. This was the end of the relatively peaceful Heian period and the beginning of **feudal Japan.**

---

**A Glimpse:** Kyoto, 1179\. Minamoto no Yoshitsune crouches barefoot on a veranda, listening to the clatter of armored men searching the garden below. He has smeared his face with soot to look like a servant; his sword lies hidden beneath a basket of winter radishes. One guard pauses, sniffing the air. Yoshitsune’s hand twitches toward the basket, knuckles whitening, but a nightingale shrieks in the branches overhead – the guard curses, distracted, and moves on. Yoshitsune exhales, his breath steaming in the cold, knowing the future of his clan hinges on his next moves.

---

The emperor’s household remained but had no real power. He was a **figurehead** only. Real power lay with the daimyos and their warriors \- the **samurai**.  The **daimyō** (literally “great names”) were feudal magnates who ruled vast hereditary estates from the provinces; they were nominally vassals of the shogun and (at least in theory) loyal to the emperor. In practice, they operated with considerable autonomy, maintaining private armies of samurai and fighting each other for influence. 

The **samurai** were more than just soldiers – they were a privileged warrior caste, bound by the ethos of **bushidō** (the “way of the warrior”), which prized loyalty, courage, and honor unto death. In these centuries, the spectacle of armored horsemen clashing in battle, and the discipline of master swordsmen practicing Zen meditation in peacetime, became defining images of Japanese culture. 

**Zen Buddhism**, in fact, took deep root among the samurai during the **Kamakura period** (1185–1333). The samurai found Zen’s emphasis on **discipline, concentration, and direct action** perfectly suited to their austere lifestyle and combat mindset. Many warriors trained their minds in Zen monasteries, seeking inner calm and clarity. Zen gardens and temples blossomed under their patronage, and concepts of mindfulness and indifference to death filtered into the samurai code.

**Shinto**, meanwhile, remained vital for its rituals affirming Japanese identity – every clan revered its own **kami**, and the imperial family was believed to descend from the sun goddess Amaterasu, lending a divine aura to the figurehead emperor. 

Feudal fragmentation was the rule, yet culture continued to thrive – Nō drama and the tea ceremony (inspired by Zen) are legacies of this period. Through all this, Japan continued to absorb elements from China (for example, **Neo-Confucian** philosophy would later be promoted in Japan), but it increasingly charted an independent course. Unlike Korea, which remained deeply under China’s cultural umbrella, Japan blended imported ideas into a unique feudal society quite unlike the centralized Confucian monarchy of China.

## **Conclusion**

East Asia before 1450 was a tapestry of diverse lands connected by shared heritage. As the year 1450 approached, East Asia stood on the cusp of new challenges – foreign conquerors, maritime voyages – but its foundations were firmly laid. The ideals of the Mandate of Heaven, the achievements of Tang and Song ingenuity, and the legacy of samurai and sages would endure, setting the stage for the history to come.
