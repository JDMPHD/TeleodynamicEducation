# **Chapter 2: Dar al-Islam and the Rise of the Turks**

## **The Split**

In the year 610 CE, in a mountain cave outside **Mecca**, a merchant named **Muhammad** ibn Abdullah experienced a vision that would change history. He heard a voice commanding him to **“Recite\!”** – thus began the revelation of the **Qur’an**. 

After initial persecution, Muhammed and a small band of followers undertook the Hijra (migration) to **Medina** in 622, an event so pivotal that it marks Year 1 of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes of the region under Islam, and within a decade, he returned in triumph to Mecca. He defeated the wealthy Umayyad family that ruled there, cleansed the **Kaaba** of idols and dedicated it to Allah. By the time Muhammed died in 632, much of Arabia had been joined into a single community, the **ummah**, fired by faith in Allah and obedience to the Qur'an.

This new faith, **Islam**, spread with incredible speed.  Muhammad’s successors – the **caliphs** (from *khalifa*, meaning successor or representative) – burst out of Arabia and into the lands of their neighbors. The most powerful empires in the region – The Eastern Roman or Byzantine empire of Constantinople and the Sassanid empire of Persia – were already weakened by decades of war against each other. By 650 CE, the Muslim world stretched from **Jerusalem** – a city considered most holy to both the Jews and the Christians, now held by the Muslim Arabs – all the way to the edges of Central Asia. 

At the same time, there was stirring a growing dispute over who should lead the ummah – Muhammad’s father-in-law and first follower, Abu Bakr, or his cousin, student, and son-in-law Ali? 

This dispute became the center of a power struggle among the early Muslims, which eventually culminated in the first **fitnah** or Muslim civil war. The third caliph, Uthman, was murdered, and **Ali** became the fourth. However, while Ali denounced the murder, many felt that he had benefited from the killing and didn't do enough to punish the assassins. Soon after, Ali himself was challenged and then assassinated.

These events eventually crystalized into **the split between Sunni and Shi’a Islam**. The **Sunni majority**, based in the homeland of Arabia, supported Abu Bakr. The **Shi’a**, who made their new center of power in **Persia**, supported Ali and his descendents in a kind of royal line. Over time, Sunnis and Shi’as developed distinct practices and beliefs. Their **schism** endures to the present day, and even still continues to erupt into persecution and violence. 

In 661, a powerful governor, **Mu’awiya**, came out on top and founded the **Umayyad Caliphate**. The **Umayyads** (661–750)  were part of the same wealthy Arabian clan that had originally opposed Mohammed in Mecca – but now they moved their capital to Mu’awiya headquarters in Damascus, out of the Arabian desert in the more centrally located region of Syria. This was a move away from the traditional and faith-based Islam of the early years and toward a more practical and political hereditary monarchy designed to expand a vast Arab empire. 

Under the Umayyas, Islamic armies pushed outward: across all of North Africa to the Atlantic, and in 711, across the **Straight of Gibraltar** and into Iberia (Spain). By 732, Muslim forces had reached as far as Tours in France before Frankish armies (led by the talented Pippin the Short) defeated them and contained Islam in what would become **al-Andalus**.

**A Glimpse:** Tariq ibn Ziyad stands on the limestone heights of the Rock of Gibraltar in 711 CE. The salt wind lifts his cloak while the rowboats below scrape against pebbles on the shore. Berber converts, fresh soldiers of *jihad*, unload sacks of grain and bundles of spears. The men glance upward at the unfamiliar green ridges of Iberia, whispering in Amazigh and Arabic. Smoke from burned supply ships still curls above the water – the flames cutting off the option of retreat. 

That night, by firelight, Tariq speaks of fertile fields beyond the mountains, promising reward to those who endure the risks and labors to come. Arabian horses stamp against the rocky ground, uneasy with the air of a strange sea. At dawn, the army will climb inland, sandals slipping on the wet stone. The narrow strait behind them will grow distant, and a new land will rise ahead – the land that they will make Muslim – the land that will become **al-Andalus.**

---

## **Umayyads and Abbasids**

In the east, the Umayyads also expanded, reaching the Indus Valley (now Pakistan) and Central Asia. Arabic became the administrative language of the realm, and the Umayyads minted their own coinage, replacing Byzantine and Persian coins with Islamic inscriptions. Yet with expansion came **overextension**. The Umayyad Empire’s immense size made centralized control impossible, and the Umayyads did not wish to share political power or privilege with non-Arabs. 

As a result, non-Arab converts often resented their second-class status, and discontentment begen spread, and in 750, these resentments boiled over. The **Abbasid** faction, supported especially by Persian Muslims, many of whom were Shi’a, overthrew the Umayyads in a bloody revolt. 

One teenage Umayyad prince escaped to Iberia and succeeded there in establishing an Umayyad dynasty. The great capital of Cordoba, and later Granada, would remain part of Umayyad in **Al-Andalus** for centuries to come – but in the rest of the Islamic world, the **Abbasid Caliphate** (750–1258) came into dominance.

With their center of power in Persia, the Abbasids shifted the empire’s focus eastward. They had a new capital built on the Tigris River in **Mesopotamia**. They named it **Baghdad**, “God-Given,” and it soon became the dazzling heart of the new **Dar al-Islam**, which means the “House of Islam” or Muslim world, in contrast to the **Dar al-Harb** which is literally the “House of War” – the non-Muslim world. 

Under the Abbasids, the Islamic empire entered a **Golden Age** of intellectual and cultural flourishing. The tales of ***A Thousand and One Nights***, also called ***Arabian Nights***, were recorded and compiled in this period, epitomizing the wealth and splendor of Baghdad. By now, Islam had become far more than a religion or Arabs; Persians, Syrians, Egyptians, Berbers and others all had all converted to Islam, and the Abbasids had come to power partly by promising to represent them fairly.

The new caliphate was thus a cosmopolitan and multicultural civilization. Arabic, however, remained the **lingua franca** (or **common tongue**) from the western tip of Africa all the way to Persia, uniting many lands in **liturgy** and learning. This made Arabic both the **liturgical tongue** (faith language) and the **official/legal tongue** of a multi-continent and multi-ethnic empire.

In Baghdad’s fabled **House of Wisdom** (*Bayt al-Hikma*), scholars of many faiths (Muslims, Christians, Jews, even ancient traditions like the Sabians) gathered to translate and expand upon the knowledge of the ancient world. Over two centuries, Greek philosophy, Indian mathematics, and Persian science were shifted into Arabic by these scholars in Abbasid Baghdad in the East and, to a lesser extent, in Umayyad Cordoba in the West. The works of Aristotle, Euclid, and Galen found new life in Arabic commentaries, while original thinkers like al-Khwarizmi (mathematician of algebra), **Ibn Sina** (latinized as Avicenna, the greatest physician since Galen), and many others pushed the frontiers of knowledge. 

Muslim scholars made breakthroughs in **mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and optics**, with technology far ahead of Europe and in certain areas even ahead of China. Baghdad’s libraries overflowed with books on philosophy and science, and its bustling **madrassas** (institutions of higher learning like the House of Wisdom) taught law and theology to students from every province.

---

**A Glimpse:** Under the latticed garden windows of Bayt al-Hikma in 9th-century Baghdad, a Nestorian Christian scribe bends over a Syriac codex of Aristotle. Opposite him, a young Muslim scholar murmurs the words aloud, shaping them into Arabic. Reed pens scratch against parchment; ink-stained fingertips arguing over the best rendering of “substance” or “form.” 

Around them, shelves sag beneath rolled papyri from Egypt’s Alexandria, palm-leaf manuscripts from India, and leather-bound Persian texts. In the courtyard, water trickles from a fountain where other students gather, reciting Sanskrit numerals and mathematics. The smell of hide mixes with fresh ink and the dust of caravans. Greek etymology sparks a debate, and a footnote is added in red. 

Beyond the walls, Baghdad hums with spice markets and bells, but here it is quiet – a tranquility broken only by the scratching pens and voices of students convinced that wisdom, in every tongue, is worth preserving.

## **The Turkic Sultans**

Yet even as Baghdad glittered, the unity of the Abbasid Caliphate began to fragment. The empire was simply too large and culturally diverse to be ruled from one city. Distant provinces began to chafe under Abbasid rule. Distant governors and generals began to plot to take local power for themselves. In Persia and Central Asia, various sultanates emerged paying only **nominal lip-service** to Abbasid authority. **Al-Andalus** broke away under its new Umayyad rule, and Egypt similarly declared independence under the **Shi’a** Fatimids who claimed descent from Muhammad’s daughter Fatima. 

Such **Shi'a** lineages broke away from the Sunni majority of Islam during the original power struggle that followed the Prophet Muhammed’s death. Unlike the more politically pragmatic and religiously exoteric Sunni – like the Abbasids – Shi’a dynasties like the Fatimids tended to blend a kind of deeper mysticism into their power structures. This blending of deeper initiated wisdom with political realities was not an easy balance, but was considered by Shi’a as the fundamental purpose of the Prophet and commandment of Islam: to create functioning and sustainable political realities based on the deeper truths and universal principles. 

Thus, the Fatimid Caliph was not only a political-religious leader, but was also understood as a kind of chief teacher: the living imam and heir to the lineage of imams dating back to the Prophet himself. This lineage was not about political power but deeper awareness of reality and mystical truth – the secrets hidden in plain sight in the teachings of the Quran and the great guide, Muhammed. In a dynasty like this one, the Caliph was not only surrounded by military and economic leaders but also was the heart of a kind of network of specialty trained and educated mystical sages, who operated as both an inner community of advisors and a web of international operatives and missionary teachers. This is quite distinct from the Sunni dynasties of the Abbasids or later groups like the Mamluks and Ottomans, who operated through more typical structures and forms of power. This difference in the role of elite wisdom masters within governance structures may help to illuminate the character of the rivalry between the Shi’a lineages (favoring direct transmission, teacher to student, across the centuries) and the Sunni majority (favoring the consensus of the larger political community and its authorities) in the Muslim world – a rivalry that continues to this day.

With so many groups breaking away and challenging their monopoly on the caliphate, the Abbasids lacked the manpower to maintain control across their vast territories. While the Arabs had proven themselves as fierce warriors over the previous centuries, there were not nearly enough of them to enforce a multi-continental empire. The solution? **Turkic muscle.** The Turkic peoples consisted of the many tribes of the Central Asian steppes – tall, tough horse nomads who dominated the battlefield through their excellence as horseback archers, much like their Mongol ethnic cousins.

After **Arabia**, **Persia**, and **the Levant**, the Turks of Central Asia were among the first to begin converting to **Islam.** Noting their extraordinary battlefield prowess, the Abbasids (and other Arab dynasties) saw an opportunity to solve their problem of **overextended manpower**. They began to import Turkish slave-soldiers known as **Mamluks** (“owned men”) to serve as elite guards and enforcers in various lands. In time, these Turkish warriors grew in influence and sometimes took over. 

By the mid-900s, a family of such Turks effectively controlled Baghdad as **sultans**, keeping the Abbasid caliph as a puppet emperor. Another group, the **Seljuk Turks**, converted **en masse** to Sunni Islam and proceeded to sweep in from the steppes with such ferocity that they had soon conquered Persia and Mesopotamia. In 1055, the Seljuks defeated the reigning sultans of Baghdad and replaced them – still keeping the Abbasid caliph as figurehead. One could draw a parallel here to the Shogun wars of Japan, in which control of the emperor was passed around like a trophy. The **rise of the Turks** thus shifted the leadership of the Islamic world from Arab and Persian elites to new Turkic dynasties, even as the **Golden Age** of the Abbasid caliphate **nominally** continued.

The Seljuks did not stop at Baghdad. They pushed into the Byzantine Empire’s shrinking territory in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and delivered a crushing blow at the **Battle of Manzikert in 1071\.** The Byzantine loss at Manzikert opened **Anatolia** to Turkic migration and is seen as a turning point. Soon, vast regions of what is now Turkey were overrun by Turkmen tribes, and within decades, the rich regions of the once Orthodox Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia was transformed into a heartland of Sunni Islam under the **Seljuk Sultanate of Rum** (their spelling of Rome).

---

**A Glimpse:** In 1071, the dust of Manzikert clings to torn banners as Byzantine foot soldiers watch Seljuk horsemen wheel through the mountain pass. Only hours before, the imperial camp had been swollen with confidence – Byzantine tents striped with colorful silk, cauldrons steaming with millet porridge, the emperor himself glittering in his decorative armor. 

The battle had not gone as planned. The Turks had feigned retreat, capitalizing on Byzantine overconfidence. Then, suddenly, they had circled back like lightning, the sky filling with their arrows. Greek fire and Byzantine artillery had been useless against their quickly wheeling flanks. They had outmaneuvered the legions. They had broken the ancient empire upon that mountain’s back.

Now the field is littered with abandoned standards, and Emperor Romanos is captive, met in private honor by Sultan Alp Arslan even as the Byzantine army dissolves in panic. A defeated soldier staggers toward a deep ravine, hearing only the whistle of Seljuk bows and the braying of wounded mules. 

Peasant families from Anatolian-Greek villages peer from doorways as columns of Turkic horse warriors ride past, bridles jangling, horses’ breath steaming in the cool mountain air. A new Turkic-Sunni order is arriving, not with proclamations, but with hoofbeats on the high roads.

---

The Seljuk victory at Manzikert and expansion toward the very borders of Europe alarmed Christendom at large, and **the Papacy** grew concerned as reports came in that Christian access to **the Holy Land** was now blocked. By 1095, the Byzantines were growing desperate. They appealed to Rome for help, prompting Pope Urban II to call the **Crusades**: a pan-European effort to take back **Jerusalem.** 

In 1099, the First Crusade succeeded in seizing the Holy City, establishing a Christian **Latin kingdom** in **the Levant** amidst great bloodshed. For the next two centuries, **Crusades** and jihads ebbed and flowed: Muslim forces under leaders like **Saladin** (Salah ad-Din) eventually recaptured Jerusalem. The Crusader states – including Jerusalem – survived in fragmentary form until the last fell in 1291\. These wars were brutal cultural collisions but also led to cross-fertilization: Europeans were exposed to advanced Islamic science and medicine, while Muslims adopted some Frankish military techniques (such as fortress design). 

---

**A Glimpse:** It is 1187 on Jerusalem’s city’s walls, and Muslim guards are watching the dust of the Crusader armies retreating after surrender. The gates open cautiously; the city is not sacked; no smoke rises. Saladin rides in slowly, his standard carried upright, ordering markets to remain open and churches of every faith to stand untouched. 

Christian captives gather in the squares – not massacred but ransomed, with wealthy men paying coin and poorer ones freed by the donations of strangers. Old women distribute bread from baskets to ensure that no one goes hungry during the transition.

Eighty-eight years earlier, Crusaders had slaughtered Muslims in these same streets, boots slipping in the blood they spilled. Now the city smells of sweat, dust, and baked bread, not fire and blood. The memory of violence lingers, but Saladin will not reach for the sword. Not this time.

## **Dar al-Islam**

**Dar al-Islam** – which can be translated equally well as the “Realm of Islam” or the “House of Peace/Submission” – is the term for the Muslim world, which historically included the Arabian and Persian heartlands and soon expanded to much of Africa, Spain, the Levant, Anatolia, Central Asia, the Indus River region, and later into much of India (by conquest) and much of Southeast Asia (by trade) where it eventually became dominant in the island kingdoms of modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia and even the southern Philippines. With the exception of Spain and India which were predominantly reclaimed by **Catholicism** and **Hinduism** respectively, Islam today continues to spread and expand in these regions and beyond.

Within the **Dar al-Islam**, a rich and diverse civilization thrived, bound by the common thread of **Sharia law**. The Quran and the Hadith (Prophet’s sayings and deeds) – govern all aspects of life under Sharia law: worship, commerce, marriage, crime, punishment, education, etc. etc. In theory, Sharia law makes no separation of “church and state”; the law was religious and civil at once, guiding everything from how to pray to how to draft contracts. Caliphs and sultans were supposed to obey Sharia and to guide its implementation – with the help of religious judges (*qadis*) and scholars (*ulama*).

 Of course, in practice, rulers tend to be pragmatic – and the Arabic-Muslim dominance of the early years became increasingly **secular** in most of Dar al-Islam over time. The Abbasids, for example, employed non-Muslim officials for their expertise and made decisions based more in politics than in scripture. But even these caliphs paid lip service to the idea that the **Qur’an** was the constitution of the land and that they were simply the messengers of Allah’s justice on earth. These laws – and the Arabic language more generally – unified a vast realm, easing trade and dissemination of knowledge across thousands of miles.

Under Sharia, **dhimmis** – non-Muslim people living under Muslim rule – were often granted protected but subordinate status. Dhimmi communities were allowed to practice their religion, follow their own communal laws in personal matters, and were often valued as physicians, translators, officials, and so on. However, they paid a special tax called **jizya** and accepted certain social disabilities (like not riding warhorses or bearing arms). Many non-Muslims found this arrangement tolerable, even preferable to previous regimes’ oppression; for example, Sects of Christianity labeled as heretics and by the Catholic Church as well as Jewish communities often welcomed Muslim rule as relatively welcoming and just. In time, substantial numbers of dhimmis converted to Islam – often to gain access to social mobility and to avoid the jizya. 

One place of particularly strong dhimmi presence was **Al-Andalus**. Under the Umayyad rule of the grand city of Córdoba – Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived side by side in a complex coexistence. **Syncretism** – the fusion of diverse traditions into creative combinations – was inevitable. The Córdoban Jewish philosopher **Maimonides**, for example, wrote commentaries on Aristotle in Arabic before moving to Cairo in Egypt to become Saladin’s personal physician. Yet, Maimonides was also a **rabbi** and **Talmudic scholar** – and his work with Hebrew and Jewish thought was constantly weaving with his **intercultural** engagement. This was the **syncretism** of al-Andalus at its finest.

Similarly, Christian monks in Spain translated Arabic scientific works (both Muslim originals and Arabic translation of classical Greek texts) into Latin, bringing knowledge like Aristotle’s philosophy and algebra into Europe. Gothic and Islamic architectural styles blended – and musicians mixed influences from across the Mediterranean. Contrary to notions of strict cultural and religious **puritanism**, history suggests that the greatest **effulgence** of creativity often happens under **syncretic conditions.**

Within the Muslim community, there was also diversity of thought and lifestyle. The orthodox **ulama** (scholars) often frowned on excesses, but **polygamy** was permitted for Muslim men (up to four wives, if they could treat them equally per the Qur’an), and wealthy rulers often had large **harems** of dozens or hundreds of **concubines**. The caliph’s harem – the private quarters of the palace where wives, concubines, children, and female relatives resided – became a symbol of royal luxury. Guarded by eunuchs (men castrated so that they could not mate with the emperor's wives), such harems were often hubs of dangerous plots, as the mothers of princes plotted for advantage and brothers found ways to turn on one another – after all, a brother left alive is a potential future rival for the throne. 

Mohammed’s original teachings are not as clearly oppressive to women as Westerners often assume – indeed, Mohammed himself was said to listen very closely and patiently to his wives. As Dar al-Islam grew, some women continued in this tradition – such as Khayzuran, Harun al-Rashid’s mother, who reportedly came to indirectly dictate much of the politics of the realm. In general, however, women under Sharia law were increasingly circumscribed by their social roles. The custom of **purdah** – female seclusion and veiling – grew more and more pronounced among the upper classes of the Abbasids, influenced by Persian and Byzantine customs as well as a conservative reading of Islam. 

High-born women appeared in public heavily veiled and traveled in curtained litters, and in some places, all women (Muslim or dhimmi) were discouraged from any communication with men outside of their families. However, actual practices varied widely: rural women and the lower classes generally moved more freely because they had to, and in some regions (like parts of Southeast Asia or among certain Turkic peoples) women enjoyed relatively greater freedom and legal rights. In practice, most Muslim men had only one wife due to economic constraints, and **Sharia law** did grant women certain protections uncommon in Europe at the time – for example, women had the right to inherit a portion of family property, to control their dowry, and to initiate divorce under specific conditions. 

While the caliphs in Baghdad basked in luxury, new powers continued to emerge on the periphery. In the 10th–12th centuries, the Islamic world witnessed the rise of the **Turkish Sultanates** and also the rise of **Sufism** – the mystical flowering of Islam. Sufi saints roamed the villages and steppes, preaching a spiritual, emotionally resonant Islam that often **syncretized** with local customs. Sufi missionaries across Eurasia and Africa adopted local languages and practices to make Islam more accessible, leading to syncretic traditions – e.g. incorporating local music and dance into devotional worship of Allah.

**A Glimpse:** At dusk on the Central Asian steppe, a circle of Sufis tighten the belts around their patched robes. A wooden flute begins its breathy tune, joined by the steady thrum of a goatskin drum. Slowly, the men begin to sway, then turn, their arms lifting as their feet carve spirals into the packed earth. 

Nomadic herders, resting from the day’s ride, linger at the edge of the circle – women with water skins while boys hold the reins of restless ponies. The chanting, low and rhythmic, repeats the divine name until it seems to merge with the pulse of the drum. 

One dervish spins so long that dust rises in a cloud of fine particulates around him. The onlookers exchange quiet glances, the melody settling in their bones. Later, long after the circle has broken, fragments of that song will linger in their memory, carried with the herds and their people across the open grassland steppe.

---

Sufi **orders** spread widely and became popular among the common folk. This helped Islam take root outside the cities, in places as far-flung as the oases of the Saharan desert and the islands of Indonesia, sometimes **syncretizing** with pre-Islamic rituals in the process. In the Middle East, Persian influences of poetry and indigenous magic fused with Islam to create particularly rich artistic and cultural forms alongside advanced mathematics and sciences. **Persian** became a **prestige language** in much of Dar al-Islam – literacy in which was a mark of high education and elite cultural status, much like Greek would later become in Europe. Such prestige languages don’t replace the dominant **lingua franca** of their regions – such as Arabic in Dar al-Islam or Latin in Europe – but those who become fluent in both are often considered the true educational elites.

By 1200, **Dar al-Islam** spanned from Spain and Morocco across North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia – and spilling down into West Africa and across the Indian subcontinent and even parts of Southeast Asia. This was not a single empire, but a **cultural-religious** collective split among many states and several caliphates – from the Abbasids in Baghdad to the Umayyads in Al-Andalus; from the Fatimids in Egypt to the Seljuks in Anatolia. Yet scholars and traders crisscrossed these regions with relative ease, protected by the universal greeting of peace: *as-salaamu alaikum.* 

A scholar from Córdoba might find a warm welcome at a madrasa in Damascus; a merchant from Cairo could do business in a Yemeni port and perform the **hajj** pilgrimage to Mecca along the way. Within this vast realm, **Sharia law** provided a baseline of legal unity, and the concept of **Dar al-Islam** provided a civilizational identity that transcended ethnicity. Lands beyond Muslim rule – called the **Dar al-Harb**, or “house of war” – were (at least according to more fundamentalist interpretations of **Sharia law**) places where **jihad** could be waged to expand Muslim territory. This had been the religious justification for the rapid expansion of Islamic territory in the early years after Mohammed – but in this later time of the **Islamic Golden Age,** jihad primarily took the form of defensive warfare against the Crusaders or Mongols, as Muslim expansion by conquest had slowed.

## **The Reconquista**

One significant chapter of the Islamic West was the long struggle of the **Reconquista**. After the initial Muslim conquest of Spain in the early 700s, small Christian enclaves survived in the north (Asturias, León, Navarre, Aragon). These mountainous Christian kingdoms fought for survival and independence, and later fought to push back against Muslim rule. The process of gradual re-expansion of Christian territory, later dubbed the **Reconquista** (“reconquest”), was off-and-on; periods of peace and coexistence (convivencia) were punctuated by religious war. 

By the 11th century, Christian forces had recaptured **Toledo** (1085), a great center of learning where translators would later turn the captured Arabic libraries into Latin translations that along with translations from Persia and Jerusalem would eventually fuel the Italian Renaissance. The tide of the Reconquista was slow and unsteady – but by the 13th century, after five centuries of gradual reclamation, nearly all of al-Andalus had returned to Christian rule. The great Umayyad capital of Cordoba fell in 1236, and by 1250 only the small **Emirate of Granada** on the southern coast remained under Muslim control – and even it was forced to pay tribute to the Christian kingdom of Castile. 

Despite its modest size, **Granada** survived for two more centuries as a last bastion of Muslim-Andalusian culture. It was during this time that **Alhambra palace** was built: a beautiful palace fortress and a final flowering of Islamic art in Spain. Soon, this too would fall into Christian hands – but its unique architectural style would stand as a testament to the remarkable interplay of cultures that had occurred in Medieval al-Andalus – just as libraries in Córdoba and Toledo would preserve classical works in both Latin and Arabic, holding the memory of the cross-pollination of the diverse traditions that would shape the mind and soul of the world to come.

## **Zoom-In: Rumi’s Whirling Heart**

In the bustling Seljuk city of Konya, Jalal ad-Din Rumi first appeared to his neighbors as a dignified scholar. Clad in sober robes, he taught Islamic law and theology to crowded halls of students, his voice calm and precise. The Mongols pressed ever deeper into Anatolia, and Konya bristled with soldiers, refugees, and fear. Yet within the city’s madrasa walls, Rumi seemed untouched by the chaos, a figure of steady orthodoxy.

Everything changed in 1244, when a wandering mystic named Shams of Tabriz arrived in Konya. Shams was weathered, fiery-eyed, and unpredictable—more beggar than jurist. When the two met, Konya whispered in disbelief: the respected scholar and the ragged dervish were inseparable. Hours turned into days as they spoke in private, Rumi’s mind and heart ignited by Shams’ fierce vision of divine love. “What I had thought of God,” Rumi confessed, “was only the husk. Shams showed me the kernel.”

Soon the transformation became visible. One evening in the market square, townsfolk stopped to stare as Rumi, once so measured, began to whirl in a slow, spiraling dance. His robe spread like a circle of light as he spun, lost in trance, verses pouring from his lips: odes to longing, joy, and union with the Beloved. Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike gathered in the square, captivated by his ecstasy. Some wept openly. Others whispered that he had gone mad. But all felt the current of something greater moving through him.

Then, as suddenly as he had appeared, Shams was gone. Some said disciples jealous of his influence drove him away; others whispered of darker deeds. Rumi searched in vain, sending letters across Anatolia, but Shams never returned. The loss cracked his heart wide open. Grief became his teacher now, and poetry its language. From his sorrow welled forth the *Masnavi*, thousands of verses weaving tales, parables, and prayers into a vast tapestry of longing for the Divine.

Later, the Mongols would come. Later, Rumi would be among the tens of thousands who would flee Persia as refugees, finding new homes  in the Turkish sultanates of Anatolia and Egypt. Rumi’s teacher and friend had vanished. Rumi’s home, too, would be lost.

Rumi’s love – encoded and remembered in divine poetry and verse – would live on.

*Come, come, whoever you are.*

*Wonderer, worshipper, lover of leaving.*

*It doesn’t matter.*

*Ours is not a caravan of despair.*

*Come, even if you have broken your vow*

*A thousand times*

*Come, yet again, come, come.*

*We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee;*  
*We are as the mountain and the echo in us is from thee.*

## **The Twilight of the Golden Age**

As the **Abbasid caliphate** waned in the 1200s, a new terror descended from the east – the Mongols, who sacked Baghdad in 1258, almost extinguishing the Abbasid line. But fuller story of the Mongol invasion belongs to a later chapter, but for now, we can note that the Abbasids were not entirely extinguished. A surviving remnant fled, and was invited to Cairo – the capital of Egypt – to serve as caliph in title under the protection of the **Mamluk Sultanate.**

**Turkic Mamluks** had been key to the Caliphates’ and Emirates’ retention of control across territories far too vast for the Arabs themselves to personally oversee. The problem is that it's very difficult to control powerful groups upon which you depend for your security. Once a group like the Mamluks becomes the key to military success, reigning them in by force is no longer an option. It becomes necessary instead to use incentives: privilege, honor, wealth, influence. Thus, what began as warrior-slaves evolves toward a caste of privileged warrior-aristocrats. At a certain point, as in Egypt in 1250, these **Mamluks**, previously introduced to the region by Saladin, dispensed with illusion and seized direct control. Notably, something very similar occurred in India in 1206, in which another set of Mamluks (led by a former slave-general) seized control of what would become the Delhi Sultanate.

When Baghdad fell to the Mongols, then, it was the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt who remained to adopt the last of the Abbasid clan and give them a ceremonial role as Caliph in Cairo. This was also a way of capturing the symbolic power of the ancient and traditional name of the Abbasids. Now, however, the power clearly belonged to the Egyptian Mamluks.

Soon after, in 1260, they proved this when they finally stopped the Mongols at the **Battle of Ayn Jalut** – the first major Mongol defeat and the end of Mongol expansion in the Middle East. The Mongolian-Muslim **Il-Khanate** would continue to rule the eastern parts of the Middle East but would never conquer Egypt or **the** **Levant** nor most of Arabia. The Turks had halted their advance.

The rising power of the Egyptian Mamluks did not stop there. They initiated a campaign to **retake Jerusalem** and finally expelled the last Crusaders from the Levant by 1291\. With this victory, the **Mamluk Sultanate**, based in Cairo, became the new center of the Islamic world, fostering a renaissance of Islamic scholarship and architecture. Under Mamluk rule from 1250–1517, Cairo grew wealthier than ever before by controlling trade through the Red Sea spice route, through Egypt, and into the Mediterranean via the docks of Alexandria, north of Cairo. 

The **House of Wisdom** in Baghdad had been destroyed, but its spirit lived on in the madrasas and observatories of Cairo in Egypt and Damascus in Syria. Scholars like Ibn Khaldun (the  historian/social theorist) and Ibn Battuta (the travel writer who journeyed some 75,000 miles across Dar al-Islam) are a testament to the vitality of the 14th-century Islamic world of North Africa and the Levant.

As the year 1450 neared, **Dar al-Islam** was a patchwork of new states and dynasties. In Anatolia, the once formidable Seljuk power had given way to small Turkish beyliks – one of which, founded by a tribal warchief named Osman, was rapidly expanding. This tribe, the Ottomans, soon became the dominant Sultanate in the region – and began knocking at the door of Byzantine Europe.

Thus, the centuries before 1450 saw **Dar al-Islam** rise like a phoenix from the Arabian deserts to become a vast realm of faith and knowledge as the Prophet Mohammed’s spiritual revolution unleashed a religious empire. The **Caliphate** evolved from the faithful rule of the **Rashidun** to the military empire of the **Umayyads**, then to the cosmopolitan syncretism of the **Abbasids**, and finally into the fragmented sultanates of the late Middle Ages. **Sunni and Shi’a** developed their distinct identities, even as **Turkic conquerors** injected blood and military might into Islam. New arts, mathematics, and technologies like the astrolabe and metallurgical advances (“Damascus Steel”) emerged – yet the **Arabic language** and the Quran remained central, and wherever one traveled in the Muslim world, one heard the same calls to prayer and found the familiar mosques pointing toward Mecca. **Dar al-Islam** endured both Crusaders and Mongols – and emerged still vibrant into the late middle ages. As a Persian poet remarked in the 1300s, “Is not the world dark? But see, the moon of Islam remains bright.”
