# **Chapter 3: Rajas and Buddhas in the Realms of South Asia, Tribal Kingdoms in Africa**

Humanity’s journey in the ancient world began in **Africa**, and from there it spread to every corner of the globe. In a series of prehistoric wanderings known as the **Out of Africa migrations**, early modern humans ventured forth from their African cradle between roughly 60,000 and 70,000 years ago. These migrations unfolded in multiple waves over millennia, carrying **Homo sapiens** into new lands across **Asia**, **Europe**, **Australia**, and eventually the Americas. Driven by the search for food and changing climates, our ancestors gradually spread across the world. 

Notably, this was not a single wave, but more like a pulsing pattern that first began in Africa but eventually spread to other source points. Central Asia, for example, became a particular origin of pulsing waves of **migration pressure.** Around **2000 BCE**, one such wave from out of Central Asia began to transform the **Indian subcontinent**. Nomadic tribes speaking **Indo-European** languages – specifically the **Indo-Aryans** – filtered down from Central Asia into the plains of the **Indus River** in the West and the **Ganges River** in the East, respectively. 

## **The Indus and the Ganges**

The newcomers brought with them their **Sanskrit** language and Vedic culture, which gradually intermingled with the local indigenous traditions. One of the most widespread local cultures they encountered was that of **the Dravidians**. The **Dravidian peoples** are considered largely indigenous to South Asia. In the South, the Dravidians remained largely independent and would evolve to become today’s South Indian Tamil cultures. In the North, society became a fusion – combining the Indo-Aryans’ Vedic heritage as the dominant caste on top of the older indigenous influences. Notably, this also encoded a form of skin color prejudice even in early India, since the new upper Indo-Aryan caste carried the lighter skin tones of Central Asia, in contrast to the darker-skinned Dravidians.

Over many generations, the Indo-Aryans’ **Vedic religion** evolved into what we now call **Hinduism**, absorbing local traditions along the way. Hinduism did not emerge as a single teaching, but rather as a broad collection of beliefs and practices that took shape in different ways and different places over time. The oldest sacred texts of this tradition, the **Vedas**, were composed during the Vedic Period (c. 1750–500 BCE) in **Sanskrit**. 

One of the most enduring aspects of ancient Indian society that developed in this time was the **caste system**. Early Vedic society had defined social classes (varnas) by function – with **Brahmins** (priests) and **Kshatriyas** (warriors) at the top, followed by **Vaishyas** (merchants) and **Shudras** (laborers). In time, this hierarchy hardened. Those outside the four varnas came to be regarded as *outcasts* – the **Dalits** or **“untouchables”** – condemned to the most despised tasks and socially ostracized.

Even as Brahmin priests and Vedic rituals dominated religious life, new ideas emerged in India that offered alternatives. By the 6th century BCE, **Siddhartha Gautama** – better known as the **Buddha** – taught a message of enlightenment that rejected the authority of the Brahmins. **Buddhism** and later **Jainism** arose as influential new traditions, emphasizing ethical living and escape from the cycle of rebirth and suffering. In East and Southeast Asia, Buddhism would expand – but in India, Hinduism and its central Vedic tradition remained the clear victor.

**A Glimpse:** A marketplace in Delhi, 1300 CE. The heat rises from the dust, thick with the scent of turmeric and cardamom. To your left, a temple bell rings out—sharp, rhythmic, ancient—as a Brahmin priest recites Sanskrit verses that have been spoken here for three thousand years. But suddenly, a new sound cuts through the air. From a minaret soaring above the Hindu rooftops, the *adhan* – the Muslim call to prayer – echoes out in Arabic. The market falls silent for a heartbeat. In this silence, two worlds are colliding.

Hinduism itself was never static. It continued to evolve – for example by embracing **Bhakti** (devotional) movements. During the first millennium CE, devotional worship of gods like **Vishnu** and **Shiva** became prominent. This was a reform of the Vedism that tended to emphasize rituals and Brahmin authority; the devotional **Bhakti movement** instead prioritized the personal journey and experiential connection with divine forces. This pushed against traditional caste stratification by perceiving every person as a potential mystic in union with divine forces and knowledge.

India changed, however, in the 8th century CE. After the Prophet Muhammed unified Arabia and initiated the spread of Islam, it was not long before it began to arrive first in the Indus river valley (what is now Pakistan) and gradually deeper and deeper into the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism would always remain the dominant religion of the people – but by around the 12th century, Turkic and Afghan warlords whose people had converted to Islam increasingly pressed in and conquered the older Hindu kingdoms of North India. This was **the** **Islamification of India**, and it culminated in the establishment of the **Delhi Sultanate** in 1206\.

The Delhi Sultanate would become one of the richest and most powerful kingdoms in the world, and would dominate northern India for over three centuries. The Delhi Sultans ruled over a Hindu-majority population but were themselves firmly Muslim – creating a complex religious hierarchy on top of the already existing Hindu caste system. In these times, the **Rajput kingdoms** – proud Hindu warrior states in places like Rajasthan – held out fiercely. Though many Rajput strongholds eventually bowed to the Delhi Sultans, some continued to successfully resist for centuries, and the Rajput defense of Hindu dharma became legendary in Indian lore. 

**A Glimpse:** In a museum in Lahore sits a gold coin from the era of Mahmud of Ghazni. Look closely. On one side, the Muslim declaration of faith is stamped in Arabic script. On the other side, the exact same message is translated into Sanskrit, the holy language of the Hindus. The coin is small – a tiny, metallic witness to the fact that even the conquerors knew they could not rule India without speaking to its soul. To rule the subcontinent, you had to become part of it.

Meanwhile, in southern India, the dynamic was quite different. The Dravidian Hindus successfully resisted Muslim expansion, and eventually formed the **Vijayanagara Empire**. Formed in 1336 on the Deccan Plateau, **Vijayanagara** became the center of Hindu civilization and reached its peak in the 1400s. With wealth pouring in from its control of the South Indian **Maritime Silk Road,** the Vijaynagara sponsored a **renaissance of Hindu art, music, and literature**. Travelers to Vijayanagara’s capital (now the famous ruins of Hampi) marveled at its bustling bazaars and grand temples – concrete proof that Indian civilization stayed robust and alive under centuries of pressure.

In this complex multi-religious environment, the **Bhakti movement**, which had started in the south, began to spread to the north as well. Bhakti saints like **Kabir** and **Guru Nanak** (who founded **Sikhism**) taught that God is One and dwells beyond all religious divides. They preached in local languages to reach the masses rather than the Sanskrit of the Hindu elites or the Arabic of the Muslim elites. They often criticized caste and ritual, advocating for a direct connection with the divine.

### ***Zoom In: The Weaver’s Song***

It is a scorching afternoon in 15th-century Varanasi. The air is thick with the smell of marigolds and funeral pyres burning on the banks of the Ganges. In a narrow, dusty alley, a low-caste weaver named Kabir sits at his loom. *Clack-thrum, clack-thrum.* The rhythm of the shuttle moving back and forth is the heartbeat of his life.

A shadow falls across his work. A group of Brahmin priests stands there, their foreheads painted with sandalwood paste, their faces tight with disgust. They are joined, strangely, by a local Qazi (Muslim judge). Usually, these two groups are enemies, but today they are united in their hatred of the weaver.

"You pollute the holy verses," the Brahmin sneers, clutching his sacred thread. "A low-caste *Julaha* has no right to speak of the mysteries of the Vedas." "You are a heretic," the Qazi adds. "You speak of God but do not bow to the West."

Kabir doesn't stop weaving. He doesn't look up. Instead he begins to sing, his voice as rough as the stone walls that echo with it. He sings not in the elite Sanskrit of the court, but in the vernacular Hindi of the street. "I am not in the temple," he sings as the shuttle flies. "I am not in the Kaaba. I am in the breath of your breath."

A crowd begins to gather – washerwomen, leather workers, street sweepers. They have been told for centuries that God lives behind gates they are forbidden to enter. But Kabir is telling them that the temple is inside their own ribs. The priests shout, demanding he be silenced, but the crowd grows louder, clapping in time with the loom. Kabir looks up, his eyes dancing with dangerous joy. He knows he is sparking a fire that neither the Brahmins nor the Imams can extinguish. He is dismantling the hierarchy that supposedly leads to heaven, one loose thread at a time.

---

The **Bhaktis** in this sense paralleled the Muslim **Sufis** – and yes, a certain amount of cross-fertilization occurred, especially as the Sufis attracted Hindu followers. Beyond this, whole new traditions (like **Sikhism)** can partly be understood as **syncretic fusions** of these influences.  Yet at the same time, dogmatic orthodoxies also grew on both sides. Certain Hindu customs grew even stricter in the face of Muslim suppression. One notorious practice among some high-caste communities was **sati** – the **ritual immolation of widows** on their husband’s funeral pyre. In some places, sati was idealized as the ultimate act of wifely loyalty – though it was relatively uncommon and later outlawed by reformers. Customs like this – alongside practices like **veiling, seclusion, and harem –** underscored the patriarchal norms entrenched in both Muslim and Hindu society, even as devotional movements (like **Bhakti,** which would eventually lead to modern **yoga**) fought to loosen social bounds.

*Deep Theme – Syncretism*

When two strong cultures collide, they rarely destroy each other completely. Instead, they bleed into one another. The interaction of Islam and Hinduism created new art, new architecture (like the Taj Mahal), and even entirely new religions like Sikhism.

## **The Jungles and the Islands**

Throughout this period, **cultural diffusion** continually shaped South and **Southeast Asia**. India’s position at the heart of the **Indian Ocean trade** ensured a steady exchange of ideas, goods, and beliefs. Hinduism and Buddhism spread outward along the trade routes, increasingly influencing the lands to India’s east. In **Southeast Asia**, local rulers embraced Indian models of kingship and culture. Indian traders and priests traveled to the courts of **Ayuthaya** (Thailand) and **Champa** (Vietnam), spreading **Sanskrit** and Indian cultural influence. Over time, native kings as far as Java (in modern Indonesia) were building **Indian-style temples** and taking on Indian titles like *raja*. 

This blending of cultures gave rise to hybrid civilizations. The **Khmer Empire** of **Cambodia** (c. 9th–15th centuries) is a prime example. Its kings, bearing Hindu names like Suryavarman and Jayavarman, built massive temples to Hindu gods in their capital, **Angkor**. The most famous of these is **Angkor Wat**, a huge temple complex dedicated to Vishnu. Interestingly, as the Khmer Empire aged, it **converted to Buddhism**, and Angkor Wat was transformed into a Buddhist shrine. 

It is worthwhile to take a short diversion here and consider how, exactly, the long island chains of Malaysia, Indonesia, and beyond became populated in the first place. Like the Indo-Aryans who spread into South Asia, the inhabitants of these islands also came from a **migratory pressure wave** pulsing over time. Unlike the Indo-Aryans, the technology driving this wave was not the horse and chariot but, rather, the mastery of seafaring and navigation. These were the **Polynesian migrations**, in which island seafarers set out first from **Formosa** (now Taiwan) to gradually spread across the Pacific Ocean with nothing more their indigenous navigational skills and their double-hulled **outrigger canoes.**

### ***Zoom In: The Void of the Pacific*** 

The year is roughly 400 CE. You are standing on the wooden deck of a massive, double-hulled voyaging canoe, the *Hokule'a*. You are thousands of miles from the nearest continent, a speck of wood floating in an endless, tumultuous void of blue. There is no coastline. There is no compass to guide you. There is only wind and the terrifying depth of the ocean.

At the stern stands the Master Navigator. He hasn’t slept in three days. His eyes are red-rimmed, scanning the horizon, but he is not despairing – he is *feeling*. He ignores the choppy waves and focuses instead on the "deep swell" – the slow, rhythmic pulse of the ocean moving beneath the canoes’ hull. He feels a slight disruption in the rhythm, a "shadow" in the water that tells him an island chain is disrupting the current a hundred miles to the northeast.

The crew watches him with a mixture of reverence and fear. They have brought everything they own – pigs, taro roots, their own children – on a voyage with no return. If the Navigator is wrong, they will die of thirst in the wet, salt desert.

The Navigator looks up. The sun is setting, and the first "steering stars" are piercing the twilight. He aligns the prow of the canoe with the rising of the Pleiades. He nods to the steersman. He has built a complete map of the Pacific Ocean inside his mind, memorizing the rising and setting points of hundreds of stars. He knows, with the certainty of a mathematician, that tomorrow will see the green peaks of a new world rising from the sea. He gestures forward. They are not lost; they are in the midst of the greatest feat of pathfinding in human history.

By about 3000–1000 BCE, the voyagers had populated **Melanesia** (islands like New Guinea and Fiji) and pushed east into **Polynesia**. They reached **Hawai’i** by around 400 CE, **Easter Island** by 1200 CE, and even **New Zealand** by roughly 1300 CE. Each new land gave rise to unique cultures adapted to local conditions, but all kept aspects of their Austronesian heritage. Throughout Polynesia, one finds ancestor worship, sophisticated tattoo arts, and many similar myths. 

One notable exception to the Polynesian settlement of the Pacific, however, is **Australia**. The **Aborigines** had arrived **much earlier** – some 50,000 years ago – and developed one of the world’s oldest continuous cultures in relative isolation. The **Aboriginal Australians** survive to this day as hunter-gatherers living in diverse environments, from deserts to rainforests, with rich oral traditions and a spiritual worldview tied to the “Dreamtime” – a spiritual realm where myth, song, story, and the natural wilderness are entwined as a single underlying reality deeper than our waking lives. Aborigines today are actively struggling to keep their culture alive in a changing world and weakened ecology.

The native traditions of the Polynesians faced a transformation with the arrival of the major religions of Asia. Buddhism and Hinduism would spread into Polynesia first – alongside the aforementioned example of **Angkor Wat** in mainland **Khmer** (Cambodia), one may also note the famed Buddhist temple of Borobudur in central Java, in Indonesia, which was constructed as early as the late 700s CE. Hindu traditions also spread into the region – just east of Java, for example, one finds the island of Bali, which to this day carries strong influences of the Hinduism that once spread among the ancestors of the Balinese. 

However, modern day Malaysians and Indonesians are not primarily Buddhist or Hindu — nor, primarily, practitioners of the indigenous traditions of their Polynesian ancestors. Around the 13th-15th centuries, Islam began a rapid spread throughout the region. Unlike in India, where Islamification expanded primarily by force, the spread in Southeast Asia was mostly peaceful and conversion was a choice. Islam, in theory, recognized all people as equal under Allah. This was often an attractive prospect for those feeling trapped within traditional castes or inflexible cultures.

Practically, Islam primarily arrived due to the seafaring mastery of **Arab and Persian traders** – these merchants had mastered the sleek **dhow** sailing ships with their triangular **lateen sails** perfectly suited for riding the fierce **monsoon winds.** These Muslim merchants had been plying the seas from the Middle East to China for centuries, and some had formed **merchant communities** in port cities like **Malacca**, Aceh, or along the coasts of Java and Sumatra. From these **expatriate enclaves**, Islam spread through a mixture of intermarriage and the influence of Sufi missionaries, mingling with the diverse traditions already present throughout the region.

Starting in the 1200s, several Indonesian polities, such as **Samudra Pasai** and later the powerful **Malacca Sultanate** (15th century), converted to Islam. The new faith often overlaid older indigenous and Hindu-Buddhist frameworks, and did not entirely replace them. Islam in Southeast Asia would remain characteristically syncretic – traditional arts, ceremonies, and culture remained under Islam.

Some places did not convert at all; for example, **Bali** retained their unique Hinduism and inland Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand, Cambodia) remained Buddhist. The **Srivijayan Empire**  (7th–13th centuries) had previously been a great Buddhist **thalassocracy** dominating trade through the **Straits of Malacca**, but by the time Islam was arriving, the Srivijaya had waned and the Muslim **Sultanate of Malacca** began to dominate. This would place the Sultanate into direct competition with the rising power of the Javanese **Majapahit** – the successor to the Srivijaya. However, the wealth generated from controlling the Straits of Malacca – the bottleneck between the China Sea and the Indian Ocean and one of the most valuable trade routes in the world – as well as support from China would give the Malaccan Sultanate the edge it needed. The **Majapahit** began to fall and Islam became the dominant power in the region.

**A Glimpse:** Watch a performance of *Wayang Kulit* in Java. The puppets are made of leather, intricate and ghostly shadows flickering against a screen. The story being told is the *Ramayana*, an ancient Hindu epic of gods and demons. But the puppeteer is Muslim. The audience is Muslim. The prayer before the show is to Allah. This is the genius of Southeast Asia: the ability to hold multiple identities at once. The shadow puppet is a symbol of a culture that didn't swap one faith for another, but layered them like sheets of colored glass.

## **The Great Southern Continent**

Forget the myth of a "dark continent" inhabited only by isolated tribes. After humans originated in Africa and spread out globally, many complex societies flourished on the continent. By 1200 CE, Africa was a network of powerful, centralized kingdoms plugged into the global economy. 

One of the most significant historical changes in Africa was the series of **Bantu migrations**. Beginning around 1000 BCE, Bantu-speaking tribes from around the region of Nigeria began spreading out southward and eastward over many centuries. They brought with them knowledge of **ironworking** and **agriculture** (especially yams and oil palms), which allowed them to thrive and displace or assimilate many of the hunter-gatherer groups they encountered. 

By 1000 CE, Bantu groups had spread all the way to southern Africa. This great migration made Bantu languages and cultural influences dominant across much of sub-Saharan Africa – from Kenya to the tip of South Africa. **Swahili**, for example – the dominant language of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and surrounding states to this day – was formed as a **trade tongue** and **lingua franca** synthesized from Bantu and Arabic to facilitate relations with the Indian Ocean economy and the Muslim world. Swahili (or **Ki’swahili** as it’s also known) was written in the Arabic script and became the medium of a rich literature and poetry of its own. 

This trade gave rise to the prosperous **Swahili city-states** between the 10th and 15th centuries. Towns like **Kilwa**, **Mombasa**, **Zanzibar**, and **Mogadishu** became cosmopolitan centers where African, Arab, Persian, and even Chinese merchants met. The **Swahili** people – a mix of Bantu Africans and immigrants from Arabia and Persia, developed a vibrant and pluralistic culture. They embraced Islam (though often superficially) and built elegant stone mosques and houses, while trading gold, ivory, and iron from the African interior in exchange for textiles, spices, and porcelain from Asia. 

Inland African kingdoms took advantage of this trade as well. In Southeastern Africa, the **Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe** (c. 11th–15th centuries) rose to prominence by controlling the flow of gold and cattle – for example by selling these exports to their trade partners on the Swahili Coast. At its height, **Great Zimbabwe** built imposing dry-stone walled enclosures – including the famous Great Enclosure with walls over 10 meters high – evidence of a powerful state armed with wealth and knowledge.

**A Glimpse:** In the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, modern archeologists find a shard of pottery. It isn’t African. It’s blue and white porcelain from the Ming Dynasty of China. Think about the hands that touched that bowl. A Chinese potter shaped it; a Malay sailor carried it; an Arab merchant bought it; a Swahili trader sold it; an African king ate from it. The world was connected.

In the meantime, in the **Horn of Africa**, one of the oldest continuous kingdoms in the world miraculously continued to thrive. This was the **Kingdom of Ethiopia,** which remarkably stood alone as the single Christian kingdom in all of Africa. Ethiopia had previously been known as Aksum (or Axum), which in the very early days of Christianity (the 4th century CE) had already converted. The ruling dynasties of Ethiopia claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba – a powerful myth that connected the dynasty directly to the biblical world.

By 1200 CE, Ethiopia stood alone as a bastion of Christianity surrounded by Muslim sultanates. Under kings like Amda Seyon and Zar’a Ya’qob, the highland empire fended off invasions by neighboring Muslim states and expanded its territory. The Ethiopian emperors presided over a diverse realm of Semitic, Cushitic, and Nilotic peoples, united by the **Ethiopian Orthodox Church**. This culture identified itself as “a New Jerusalem” – and in the 12th–13th centuries, the Ethiopian **Zagwe dynasty** constructed incredible rock-hewn churches at **Lalibela**, literally carving cathedrals into living mountain rock. By 1450, Ethiopia had managed to reestablish contact with its lost Christian brethren in Europe; the Europeans were amazed, recounting legends of a Christian “Prester John” in Africa. Many believed they had found a lost kingdom of their own faith, which had miraculously survived.

### ***Zoom In: The Stone Cutter's Prayer*** 

High in the Lasta Mountains of Ethiopia, the year is 1200 CE. The air is thin and cold, but Gebre is sweating. He is standing in a deep, rectangular pit, covered in red volcanic dust. In his hand is a heavy iron chisel.

Gebre is tired. His grandfather worked on this rock, and his son will work on it after him. They are doing something that defies all reason: they are building a cathedral – the Church of Saint George – but they are not building it *up*. They are carving it *down*.

He strikes the rock. A chip of red stone flies off. He is carving a window frame, intricate and perfect, into the bedrock. There is no room for error. If he strikes too hard and cracks the stone, there is no replacement. The entire mountain is one single piece of art.

Above him, on the rim of the pit, King Lalibela watches. The King has declared that since the road to Jerusalem is blocked by Muslim conquests, they will build a "New Jerusalem" here in Africa. Gebre pauses to wipe the grit from his eyes. He looks at the cross-shape of the roof, now level with the ground above him. He feels a strange vibration in his arms – not just from the impact of the chisel, but from the chanting of priests in the finished church next door. He strikes the rock again. He is not just a laborer; he is an act of prayer in motion, carving his faith into the very skeleton of the earth.

---

Across these regions, **cultural diffusion** was constant: ideas, technologies, and beliefs flowed alongside trade goods. From the iron tools carried by Bantu farmers to the Arabic words embedded in Swahili, from the Hindu epics retold in Javanese shadow-puppet plays to the Persian miniatures treasured at the courts of Muslim Sultanates, cross-cultural currents enriched these societies. The world before 1450 was not a scattering of isolated tribes; it was an interconnected tapestry – and a prelude to the age of globalization to come. While distinct and unique, each culture remained part of an unfinished story that began with small bands of people walking out of Africa into a new wilderness, sixty millennia ago.

## **The Big Questions:**

* **Geography as Destiny:** Why did the "pulsing waves" of migration reach some places (India, Indonesia) but leave others (Australia) in isolation for 50,000 years?  
* **The Price of Fusion:** When cultures blend (like in India or the Swahili coast), what is gained is innovation. But what is lost? Did the uniqueness of the original cultures fade?  
* **Faith and Power:** In India, Islam was a tool of conquest. In Indonesia, it was a tool of trade. How does the *way* a religion arrives shape its practice and its history?

**Looking Ahead:** As the 1400s draw to a close, these regional networks – the Indian Ocean trade, the Trans-Saharan trade, the Silk Road – are all about to be disrupted. A new set of ships is leaving Portugal and Spain. They are looking for the very spices and gold we just saw in Java and Zimbabwe. When they arrive, the era of separate realms will end, and the era of global domination will begin.
